 26 internal nodes are used for handling degrees of freedom on pilot     
 nodes of rigid target surfaces.

 constant set 46 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements          
 (e.g.18925) in real constant set 50 which can cause overconstraint.

 *WARNING*: Node 945 has been used on different contact pairs (real ID   
 42 & 46).  These two pairs will be merged.  Please check the model      
 carefully.                                                              
 *WARNING*: Some MPC/Lagrange based elements (e.g.18855) in real         
 constant set 46 overlap with other MPC/Lagrange based elements          
 (e.g.18925) in real constant set 50 which can cause overconstraint.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.                                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.734   TIME= 01:02:36
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
