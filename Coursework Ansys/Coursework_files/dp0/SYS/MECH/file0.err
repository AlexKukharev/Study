/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 19.1      BUILD 19.1      UP20180418       01:02:33

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.750   TIME= 01:02:34
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.750   TIME= 01:02:34
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.812   TIME= 01:02:34
 Material number 91 (used by element 17248) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 01:02:35
 Maximum contact stiffness 2.002498355E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 01:02:35
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 01:02:35
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 2027).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 01:02:35
 Certain contact elements (for example 19694 & 19786) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 01:02:35
 Certain contact pairs (for example 74 & 70) overlap with other.         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.516   TIME= 01:02:35
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 1 of        
 contact node 1677.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.      
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.734   TIME= 01:02:36
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
